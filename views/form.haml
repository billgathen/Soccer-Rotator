      %h1 Welcome to the Soccer Rotator!
      %p Currently, the Soccer Rotator only handles a six-position (2 forwards, 1 midfielder, 2 defenders, 1 keeper), nine-player team and a six-game half-season under an AYSO-style constant-rotation system, because that's what my son plays. :-)
      %p Fill in the games fields below (date, time, location, field and opposing team is suggested), then the player fields and press "create".
    #form
      %form{:action => 'schedule', :method => 'get'}
        #games
          %h2 Games
          - 6.times do |idx|
            %h3= "Game #{idx+1}"
            %input{:type => "text", :name => "game", :size => 80}
            %br
        #players
          %h2 Players
          - 9.times do |idx|
            %h3= "Player #{idx+1}"
            %input{:type => "text", :name => "game", :size => 40}
            %br
        #controls
          %input{:type => "submit", :value => "Create!"}
